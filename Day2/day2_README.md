# Day 2 — Conditionals & Loops (DSA by Alekhya)

## Overview
On Day 2, I practiced **decision-making** in C++ using conditional statements and learned how to perform **repetitive tasks** using loops.  
I also implemented small programs for **mathematical problems**, **character analysis**, and **number checks**.


##  Topics Covered
### 1️ Conditional Statements
- `if`, `else if`, and `else`  
- Nested conditionals  
- Ternary operator (`?:`)  

### 2️ Loops
- **for loop** → When we know the exact number of iterations  
- **while loop** → When we don't know iterations beforehand  
- **do-while loop** → Executes at least once, even if condition is false initially

| `CaseFinder.cpp` | Detects if input character is uppercase, lowercase, or invalid |
| `EVENorODD.cpp` | Checks if a number is even or odd |
| `forLoop.cpp` | Demonstrates `for` loop by printing numbers in sequence |
| `whileLoop.cpp` | Demonstrates `while` loop by printing numbers in sequence |
| `doWhile_Loop.cpp` | Demonstrates `do-while` loop by printing numbers in sequence |
| `if_else-Statements.cpp` | Simple `if-else` example for decision-making |
| `if_elseif-Statements.cpp` | Grade calculation based on marks |
| `Ternary-Statements.cpp` | Uses ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative |
| `isPrime.cpp` | Checks if a number is prime |
| `oddSum.cpp` | Calculates sum of odd numbers up to `n` |

##  Key Learnings
- Conditionals help **control program flow** based on conditions.
- Loops help **avoid repetitive code** and make programs efficient.
- `do-while` is useful when you need the loop to run at least once.
- The ternary operator is a **short-hand** for `if-else`.
