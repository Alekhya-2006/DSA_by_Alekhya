# Day 1 â€“ C++ Basics: Variables, Data Types & Operators

This folder contains my practice files for the first day of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) preparation using C++.  
These programs cover the basic building blocks of the C++ language including variables, data types, type casting, and different types of operators.


## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

- Variables & Constants
- Data Types in C++
- Type Casting
- Arithmetic Operators
- Relational Operators
- Logical Operators

| File Name                | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `variables.cpp`          | Declaring and initializing variables. Understanding constants.              |
| `DataTypes.cpp`          | Demonstrating built-in data types (int, float, char, double, bool).         |
| `typeCasting.cpp`        | Examples of implicit and explicit type casting.                             |
| `ArithmeticOperators.cpp`| Performing basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /, %.                      |
| `RelationalOperators.cpp`| Using operators like >, <, ==, !=, >=, <= to compare values.                |
| `LogicalOperators.cpp`   | Demonstrating logical operations: AND (&&), OR (||), NOT (!). âœ… Uploaded!  |


## ðŸ’¡ Learnings & Notes

- C++ is a statically-typed language, meaning variables must be declared with a type.
- Logical and relational operators are key in decision-making and conditions.
- Type casting helps when we need to convert one type to another manually.
- Comments help improve readability â€” both for others and for future revisions.


## ðŸ”— Next Steps

- Day 2: Conditionals (if, else, switch) and Loops (while, for, do-while)
- Upload code with consistent formatting and meaningful file names.
- Keep practicing and documenting each day's learning.
