# DSA by Alekhya

This repo is my personal log of learning **Data Structures & Algorithms** from scratch.  
I’m uploading my daily progress here — each day has a folder with code, notes, and practice problems

##  My DSA Plan

I’m starting with basics and slowly moving to advanced topics, while solving problems on **HackerRank** and **LeetCode**.

**Day 1** – Variables, Data Types, Operators (HackerRank practice)  
**Day 2** – Input/Output, Conditionals, Loops  
**Day 3** –  Patterns
**Day 4 onwards** – Functions, Arrays, Strings Recursion, Searching, Sorting, OOP, Advanced DSA


## How I’m Tracking Progress
-  Learn 1 topic per day (sometimes more if I have time)  
-  Solve 3–5 problems related to that topic  
-  Revise previous topics before starting new ones  
-  Push everything to GitHub at the end of the day


## Tools I’m Using
- **Language:** C++ (and a bit of C for basics)
- **Editor:** VS Code
- **Platforms:** HackerRank (for basics), LeetCode (for problem-solving)


## Why I’m Doing This
I want to:
1. Build a solid DSA foundation  
2. Create a public record of my learning  
3. Improve my problem-solving speed  
4. Make my GitHub profile stronger for internships & future research

*This is not just about uploading code — it’s about building a habit and tracking my journey one day at a time.*
